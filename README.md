# Student Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based Student Management System** developed as part of my **Java Developer Internship**. The application allows users to manage student details such as name, age, grade, student ID, and contact number using a **menu-driven console interface**. The project focuses on applying **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
